- I figured that it is so much easier to work with JS than learning whole D3 library. Nevertheless, it is also usefull if to know it well.
- Actually learn enormous importance of order in which script should be written.
- Work with data was interesting, but difficult because of large gap.
- Surprisingly, but I finally understood more and more advantages of functions (especially how to reusing them can be helpful).
- It was a good practice for improving my own work flow.
- I finally have success with JSON, which I could not reach in my midterm project for instance (but unfortunately havent get success with AJAX).


							P.S. I probably will never work as a web developer, but this class provided me with understanding JS as a great sketching tool (at least). Thank you.
